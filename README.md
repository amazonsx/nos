A os with these features: 
  * All components are pluggable, hot plug supportive.
  * Clarified architecture and impelemtation for component extension and replacement.

Original Intention:
This os could be used as a testbed for new-born technique experiments.
So there is no plan to build this into a common os, just developer/researcher-oriented.
In the future, these techniques may be migrated into linux, et al. 
Hope this work could work.
